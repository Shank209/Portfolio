				<h1>About</h1>

				<p>Hello visitor, I'm Harsha, a web developer currently living in Chennai. I love what I do, which is building elegant, efficient and attractive websites. It's been about 3 years since I built my first webpage and I've only been making more and more ever since.</p>

				<br />

				<p>I love working with HTML, CSS, javascript, AJAX, PHP and MySQL. I'm very fond of jQuery and have a decent C++/algorithmic background. Apart from this, I like using CodeIgniter as my PHP framework and the Facebook open graph API. Also, I'm used to hosting and maintaining virtual servers on ubuntu machines, installing SSL certificates, etc.</p>

				<br />

				<p> I give top priority to two things when I'm building a website - 1. Does it look and feel good? 2. Does it load fast? Because were you ever impressed by an ugly slow website? Probably not.</p>

				<br />

				<p>I taught myself all the languages I know. I'm a quick learner and I always enjoy learning new things.</p>

				<p style="text-align:justify;">This is Litagram, a story writing platform with social sharing and gamification that I developed from scratch including the interface design, for a startup where I'm currently employed.
				It was officially launched on March 10th, 2015 and had been doing great with over 3,000 visitors each day so far.</p>

				<p style="text-align:justify;">Developing this website was a great experience for me. Not only did it give me a chance to improve my technical skills even further, it gave me a better understanding of how a site's design needs to be, how it's workflow needs to be and how to think from a user's point of view in order to improve user-engagement, make sure the user interacts with the site the way it is intended to be used and just satisfy and appeal to the user in general.</p>
